# Green 500 systems
Every 6 months some lists 
https://www.top500.org/lists/top500/, https://www.top500.org/lists/green500/ are published of the fastest computers in the world. 
These lists include information on where the computers are, how fast they ran a benchmark calculation and how much power
they used when running the benchmakr.

# Energy source generation mix
Depending on a computers location it may take energy from more or less CO2 emiting generators. 
This page show how energy source vary state by state in the US https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/.

# Energy mix of specific data centers
For some facilities you can find more detailed information on their local energy source CO2 emissions. For example, this
page https://www.hged.com/community-environment/green%20initiative/our-energy-mix.aspx shows the enrgy mix for these
facilities https://www.mghpcc.org, https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/cyber-security-and-information-sciences/lincoln-laboratory-supercomputing-center
in the Top 500 list.
