# Green 500 systems
Every 6 months some lists 
https://www.top500.org/lists/top500/, https://www.top500.org/lists/green500/ are published of the fastest computers in the world. 
These lists include information on where the computers are, how fast they ran a benchmark calculation and how much power
they used when running the benchmakr.

# Energy source generation mix
Depending on a computers location it may take energy from more or less CO2 emiting generators. 
This page show how energy source vary state by state in the US https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/.

# Energy mix of specific data centers
For some facilities you can find more detailed information on their local energy source CO2 emissions. For example, this
page https://www.hged.com/community-environment/green%20initiative/our-energy-mix.aspx shows the enrgy mix for these
facilities https://www.mghpcc.org, https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/cyber-security-and-information-sciences/lincoln-laboratory-supercomputing-center
in the Top 500 list. A sense of the global mix of energy sources can be read from here, https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-worlds-coal-power-plants. 


# Data center locations
Have you ever wondered physically where the cloud is. This site https://www.datacenters.com/locations is great for figuring out where the hardware is and what energy mix 
it is using. 

# Prior art
Here is a site https://mlco2.github.io/impact/#home where you can calculate a Machine Learning CO2 estimate. Its kind of boring, but it does have some useful information. 

# What about data center energy efficiency
In some data centers 50% of the energy used is going toward keeping computers cool, in others it is less than 15%. This is called Power Usage Efficiency (PUE) and it can vary between sites. This is a fun site https://www.nrel.gov/computational-science/measuring-efficiency-pue.html with a dashboard that talks about PUE at a datacenter in Colarado, US. More information on PUE is linked through here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_usage_effectiveness .
