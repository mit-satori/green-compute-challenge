Green Compute Challenge Repo


MIT and IBM  are coming together to offer the "green compute challenge" at HackMIT 

High-performance computing is changing the world ! From AI machine learning to large climate prediction models, high-performance computing is helping us make the world a better place. At the same time, high-performance computing is extremely energy intensive. Some predictions using current growth rates  show that artificial intelligence computing alone  will take more than 30% of the worlds energy resources by the end of the 2030's. We can't let that happen !!!! 
We are motivated by the fact that  the IBM donated MIT Satori Supercomputer was recently named the  6th   most energy efficient high  performance computer in the world. Satori lives in the Massachusetts Green High-Performance Computing Center  (http://mghpcc.org) which uses 97% renewable energy. To put that in perspective:  a typical high performance benchmark on Satori uses about 5 maple trees worth of carbon vs. about 280  maple trees worth of carbon writing on a "typical" data center. That's a huge difference !!!  

The HackMIT  MIT-IBM Green Compute Challenge is looking for ways  to lower the carbon footprint of high performance computation by raising peoples awareness of the carbon cost of their computer usage. By raising awareness we can improve  the   efficiency of our computers, build better computation models and change user behavior about how we use compute.  

This challenge will give $500 to the project that helps me energy and or carbon awareness easier... and more fun..  to calculate. The winning project will show a way for anyone to calculate ... and hopefully reduce ... the carbon footprint of his/her computation. etc. We have lots of ideas and input data on the energy efficiency of various computer platforms, the energy mix of data centers by geography, etc, and would love to help you formulate your solution. 

Come help us change the world and make green high performance computing a reality  


How can we make it fun, create some interesting interactive competition between big compute users like different universities. How Green is MIT compared to Stanford, or CMU?
